The theory of spectra exposed in the thesis of the first author {%cite coste:1979%} is not at first very pleasant. The goal of this text is to briefly present a different approach. This approach has been developed by the second author --- influenced by the lecture "Algebraic groups" by Gabriel and Demazure --- in unpublished notes. It intersects with the considerations of Joyal on local homeomorphisms in a topos. We finish by showing how the real étale topos is naturally introduced in this context.

The point of view adopted here is clearly geometrical. The construction of spectra then appears as a means to represent affine varieties and varieties obtained from them by a formal gluing process as ringed or "locally ringed" topoi of a certain type (cf. schemes, étale topoi of a scheme, or the algebraic spaces of Artin). We hope that this gives the theory a less indigestible character.

In everything that follows, $k$ denotes a base commutative ring and $M$ denotes the category of affine algebraic varieties over $k$, i.e. the opposite of the category of finitely presented $k$-algebras.
