In fact, consider $G : Y \to Z$. Using {%cref 001V%}) for $\vf$, we have $\cate{Nat}(FS,GT)\cong \cate{Nat}(Fd_0, Gd_1,G)$, and by the assumption made on $\beta$, we have that the latter is isomorphic to $\cate{Nat}(RV,G)$. Hence, $(R*\vf) \c (\beta * S) : FS \To RVT$ is an extensions, and moreover it is pointwise, thanks to Theorem 1.6.

For the converse, {%cref 001P%}) means that for every $x\in X_0$ the diagram
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
A \ar[rr]^T\ar[d]_S && Y\ar[d]^V  \\
X\ar[dr]_{X[x,\firstblank]} \ar[rr]_U && B \ulltwocell<\omit>{\vf}\ar[dl]^{B[Ux,\firstblank]} \\
&\Set \utwocell<\omit>{i_x} &
}
{%endtex%}
(with $i_x(y) : X[x,y] \to B[Ux, Uy]$ the action of $U$ on morphisms) is a pointwise exension. To conclude, it remains to check that $B[Ux, \firstblank]$ is the pointwise extension of $X[x,\firstblank]$ along $U$.
