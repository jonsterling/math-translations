In the 2-category $\Cat$, an exact square (cf. {cite 4}) consists of four functors $S,T,U,V$ and a natural transformation $\varphi : U\circ S\To V\circ T$,

{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
  A\ar[r]^T\ar[d]_S  & Y\ar[d]^V  \\
  X \ar[r]_U & \ultwocell<\omit>{\varphi} B
}
{%endtex%}
such that in $\Prof$ the 2-cell $\tilde\varphi : S\diamond T^o \To U^o\diamond V$ is invertible, or equivalently that the maps

$$ \tilde\varphi_{x,y}(a) : X(x,Sa)\times Y(Ta,y) \to B(Ux, Vy) : (m,n)\mapsto Vn\circ \varphi_A\circ Um $$

induce an isomorphism

$$ \displaystyle\int^a X(x,Sa)\times Y(Ta,y) \cong B(Ux, Vy). $$

In addition to all examples in {cite 4} recalled in ยง3, we also recall that $\varphi$ is exact if and only if for all pointwise Kan extensions in $\Cat$ of the form
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
  X \ar[rr]^U \ar[dr] && B\ar[dl] \\
  & \bullet \utwocell<\omit>{\lambda}&
}
{%endtex%}
the composite figure
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix@C=5mm{
  \bullet \ar[rr]\ar[d]&& \bullet\ar[d] \\
  X \ar[rr]^U \ar[dr] && B\ar[dl] \\
  & \bullet \utwocell<\omit>{\lambda}&
}
{%endtex%}
remains a pointwise Kan extension.

Bourn and Cordier have shown in {cite 1} that the same preservation property of pointwise extensions is true in $\Prof$, from whence they deduce that an exact square is the most general situation where one has a factorization
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix@C=5mm{
  A \ar[r]^T\ar[d]_S & Y\ar[d]^V \\
  X\ar[d] \ar[r]_U & B\ar[d] \ultwocell<\omit>{\varphi}\\
  \Kl(T_S) \ar@{.>}[r] & \Kl(T_V)
}
{%endtex%}
where $T_S$ and $T_V$ are, respectively, the codensity monads of $S$ and $V$.

We can also regard an exact square $\varphi$ as a generalized ternary decomposition of $B$, by virtue of the following example.

Let $E,D,M$ be three subcategories of $B$, and let $A$ be the category having as objects all morphisms of $D$ and as morphisms the commutative squares
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
  bla
}
{%endtex%}
where $u,v$ are invertible. Then $(E,D,M$ is a ternary decomposition of $B$ if and only if the square
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
  bla
}
{%endtex%}
is exact, if we posit $\varphi=d$.

An exact square is said to be *sub-exact* (resp., *sur-exact*) if and only if for each pair $(x,y)$ of objects in $X\times Y$, $\tilde\varphi_{x,y}$ is injective (resp., surjective).

Any given square $\varphi$ can be decomposed into $\varphi = i \otimes_\epsilon s$, where $\epsilon$ is an exact square, $\otimes_\epsilon$ the multiplicative structure (cf. {cite 4}, ยง1.5) induced by $\epsilon$, $i$ a sub-exact square, and $s$ a sur-exact square. This result is a 2-dimensional version of the 1-dimensional epi-mono factorization theorem.
