A mono from $X$ to $Y$ is characterized by the fact that its kernel pair is the diagonal of $X$.

The characteristic function of the diagonal $\Delta\Sub{X}$, written
$\gl{=\Sub{X}}$, has the arrow ${=\Sub{X}} : \ObjTerm{\ECat}\to
\Omega\Sup{X\times X}$ for its cartesian adjoint.

The "kernel pair" operation from $Y\Sup{X}$ to $\Omega\Sup{X\times X}$ (written $\hat{\phi}$) can be obtained as the adjoint of the arrow from $Y\Sup{X}\times X\times X$ to $\Omega$ that classifies the subobject $k:K\rightarrowtail Y\Sup{X}\times X\times X$ equalizing the following two horizontal maps:
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
\node (w) {$Y\Sup{X}\times X\times X$};
\node (n) [above right = 2.5cm of w, xshift = 1cm] {$Y\Sup{X}\times X$};
\node (s) [below right = 2.5cm of w, xshift = 1cm] {$Y\Sup{X}\times X$};
\node (e) [below right = 2.5cm of n, xshift = 1cm] {$Y$};
\draw[->] (w) to node [sloped,above] {$Y\Sup{X}\times \pi\Sub{1}$} (n);
\draw[->] (w) to node [sloped,below] {$Y\Sup{X}\times \pi\Sub{2}$} (s);
\draw[->] (n) to node [sloped,above] {$\Con{ev}$} (e);
\draw[->] (s) to node [sloped,below] {$\Con{ev}$} (e);
\end{tikzpicture}
»

(that is to say, in $\SET$, the set of triples $\prn{f,x\Sub{1},x\Sub{2}}$ such that $f\prn{x\Sub{1}} = f\Sub{x\Sub{2}}$).

The object $\MONO{X}{Y}$ is then defined by the following fiber product:
«
\DiagramSquare{
  nw/style = pullback,
  nw = \MONO{X}{Y},
  ne = \ObjTerm{\ECat},
  sw = Y\Sup{X},
  south = \hat{\phi},
  east/style = >->,
  west/style = >->,
}
