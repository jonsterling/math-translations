In {%cref 001E%}, we define and characterise exact squares in a Yoneda structure in the sense of Street-Walters {%cite Street1978%}, and we underline the possibility of defining *pointwise squares* in this framework. Maybe when we have sufficiently understood the link between exact and pointwise squares, we can construct a solid axiomatic approach to exactness in a 2-category.
