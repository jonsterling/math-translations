title: Uniform Yoneda structure
taxon: definition

We call *uniform Yoneda structure* on $\mathbb K$ a Yoneda structure as defined above in the sense of {%cite Street1978%}, where in addition

- each extension $\chi^f$ is pointwise;
- for every $g : B\to PC$ there exists $Z$ and $B\xto{b} Z \xto{c} C$ such that $g = Pc\circ Y_Z\circ b$.

Examples of such structure: $\Cat$, uniform cosmoi of {%cite Street1974%}.
