- In a 2-category $\mathbb K$ with a Yoneda structure, an admissible square $\vf : \esq{S}{U}{T}{V}$ is exact according to BC# if and only if the diagram
  {%tex macrolib: guitart%}
  \xymatrix@C=.5cm{
    A \ar[d]_S\ar[rr]^T & & Y\ar[d]^V  \\
    X \ar[dr]_{Y_X}\ar[rr] && B \ulltwocell<\omit>{\vf}\ar[dl]^{B(U,1)} \\
    & PX \utwocell<\omit>{\chi^U}&
  }
  {%endtex%}
  exhibits $B(U,1)\circ V$ as the left extension of $Y_X\circ S$ along $T$. This is condition PP#
- If the Yoneda structure is uniform conditions BC# and PP# are equivalent for the squares $\vf$ such that $U$ is admissible.
- Relative adjunctions and, more in general, absolute extensions are (as in the case of $\Cat$) exact squares in the sense of BC#.
