In {%cref 001C%}, we analyse the problem of *exact grids*, and in {%cref 001D%} we indicate a possible solution to this problem through "relational calculi"; we observe that all the different ways to approach the calculus of relations (BÃ©nabou, Guitart, Hilton, Meisen, Street-Walters, Coppey) each induce a notion of exactness, and reciprocally, every notion of exactness determines a congruence on a bicategory of spans, in a certain way representing it.
