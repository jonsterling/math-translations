title: The little étale topos
---

Let us now choose an affine variety $V$. Let $\ET/V$ be the full subcategory of $M/V$ spanned elementary étalés over $V$. $\ET/V$ inherits a Grothendieck topology from the localization datum. Let $\Sh{\ET/V}$ be the topos of sheaves for this topology. The objects of $\Sh{\ET/V}$ are obtained by gluing elementary étalés over $V$; it is thus natural to think of them as the *étalés over $V$*.
