title: Consistent functor, C' condition
---
A functor $F :  A \to  B$ is called *consistent* if it satisfies Frei's "C condition" {%cite frei1976categorical%}, which following {%cite 10.1007/978-3-642-99902-4_11%} p. 241 is equivalent to the following condition: for all $A\in A_o$, $FA \cong \varprojlim \big( FA\downarrow F \to  A \xto{F}  B \big)$, and which, following Linton {%cite 10.1007/BFb0083080%} is equivalent to the fact that $\exp_F^\op$ is fully faithful on the pairs $(B,FA)$.
