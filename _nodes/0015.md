The scope of the present text is to build a bridge between logic and homology by exposing the calculus of exactness (and its connections with the calculus of relations) in a symmetric 2-category (ยง3) and in a uniform Yoneda structure (ยง4) in a general fashion, but first of all in the particular case of the 2-category $\Cat$.

ยง1 introduces the concept of *exact square* in a representable 2-category (cf. H. ยง1.4).
