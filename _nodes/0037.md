Let $\mathbb C$ be a 2-category equipped with a class $\mathbb E$ of squares called exacts (for example, the exact squares in the sense of $H$ or $H^\op$ or $M$, cf. {%cite guitart:1980%}), and let $K$ be a class of morphisms of $\mathbb C$ called "canonical comparisons" (for example, monomorphisms of $\mathbb C$, or epimorphisms, or morphisms in $\mathbb C$ having an adjoint 1-cell,...). In the same notation of ยง9 we give the following definition.

@include{0038}

The 2-category $\Rel_{\mathbb E,K}(\mathbb C)$ has objects those of $\mathbb C$ and as morphisms the elements of $Re(\mathbb E)$, called *relations*, and 2-morphisms generated by the $\mathbb E$-$K$-deductive squares, that will be called *proofs*.

This way to describe the 2-category of relations improves the one given in ยง3 of {%cite guitart:1980%}.
