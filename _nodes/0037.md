Let $\mathbb C$ be a 2-category equipped with a class $\mathbb E$ of squares called exacts (for example, the exact squares in the sense of $H$ or $H^\op$ or $M$, cf. {cite 4}), and let $K$ be a class of morphisms of $\mathbb C$ called "canonical comparisons" (for example, monomorphisms of $\mathbb C$, or epimorphisms, or morphisms in $\mathbb C$ having an adjoint 1-cell,...). In the same notation of ยง9 we give the following definition.
