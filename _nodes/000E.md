We have translated Bénabou's "équivalence nucléaire" as "kernel pair". We have
translated Bénabou's "noyau du couple" as "equalizer" --- a usage of the French
school that is explained by Grothendieck in his 1965-1966 lectures on basic
category theory {%cite grothendieck:1966:ilf -A --label definition --locator
I.6.3.2 %}. I have also renamed some of the labels in the first commutative diagram of
{%cref 000B%} for clarity.
