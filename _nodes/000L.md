This is a hypertext English translation of Bénabou's famous report *Problèmes
dans les topos*; errors in translation belong to me alone. I have taken some liberties to ensure readability. Node numberings of the form **1.2.3** are guaranteed to be the same as in the
source text; in places, I have introduced more granular node subdivisions than
Bénabou; for instance, a subnode of **1.2.3** introduced in translation could
be numbered **1.2.3·a**. I have added titles to many sections in order to facilitate a useful table of
contents.

 The original French manuscript of Bénabou can be accessed [here](assets/benabou.pdf).
