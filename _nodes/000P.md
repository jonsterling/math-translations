title: The big Ã©tale topos
---

Let $\Sh{M}$ be the topos of sheaves on $M$ with the topology of the localization datum. We denote by $\Yo : M \to \Sh{M}$ the canonical functor. The objects of $\Sh{M}$ are obtained by gluing of affine varieties; the method of gluing is specified by the topology on $M$.
