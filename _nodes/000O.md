We are then in possession of a *localization datum on $M$*. A localization datum is therefore no more than a Grothendieck topology on $M$ in which we have specified the morphisms that are used to make the covers. In algebraic geometry there are well-known localization datums: the Zariski topology with open immersions, and the étale topology with étale morphisms.
