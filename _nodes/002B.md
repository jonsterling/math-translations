The main motivation for our definition and our study of exact squares, as exposed through sections 1 to 4 was the study of Paré's thesis about absolute limits {%cite pare1969absolute%} and the characterizations of absolute extensions given in {%cite guitart1977absolues%} (partially continuing on the line of some results in Thiébaud {%cite thiebaud%} and Harting {%cite harting1977distributoren%}).

We call *absolute left extension* a diagram in $\Cat$ of the form
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
 X \ar[rr]^U \ar[dr]_F &&  Y\ar[dl]^R \\
&  Z \utwocell<\omit>{\vf}&
}
{%endtex%}
such that for each $H:  Z\to K$ the composite $H\vf$ is a left extension (i.e. $HR\cong \Lan_J HF$).
