The idea of working in additive categories with exact squares instead of exact sequences dates back to Lambek, Mac Lane, Puppe, and a large part of what can be done is exposed in Hilton {cite ???}. About te use of exact squares in non-additive categories, and the relation with the problem of embedding the ambient category in various categories with involution, we advise the reader to consult {cite ???} or other references (for example ÄŒalenko and Conte).

The advantage of this point of view lies in the following *key observation*: we can obtain the composition of two relations-spans $A\leftarrow X\to B$ and $B\leftarrow Y\to C$ as follows:
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
  &&Z\ar[dr]\ar[dl]\\
  & X\ar@{}[rr]|\star \ar[dr]\ar[dl]&& Y\ar[dr]\ar[dl] \\
  A && B && C
}
{%endtex%}
where $*$ is any exact square (see {cite ???}, p. 35 and {cite ???}, p 22). As a consequence, the study of formation laws for exact squares in a category of the form $\Set^{C^\op}$ allows to understand the calculus of relations of $\Set^{C^\op}$ and as a consequence the deductive logic of this topos.

However, since we know that the logics of categories like $\Set^{C^\op}$ "are" the natural semantics for intuitionistic logic, we see that the method of exact squares is, in fact, larger than intuitionism. Intuitionism is, in some sense, the discrete or 1-dimensional part of *fibered exact logic* introduced in {cite ???} as a principal part of categorical logic. Fibered exact logic in a category $C$ is the study of formation laws of exact squares in the 2-categories $\Cat^{C^\op}$, $\Fib(C)$, $\underline{D}(C)$, $\Cat/C$,... (the second principal part of categorical logic on $C$ is the study of fibered monads on $C$, i.e. of monads in $\Cat^{C^\op}$, $\Fib(C)$, $\underline{D}(C)$, $\Cat/C$,...)
