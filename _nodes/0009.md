This suggests that by preceding the adjoint in question by the embedding $I$ we
shall obtain the "existential quantification" (which sends $X$ to
$\Omega\Sup{X}$ and $f$ to $\exists\Sub{f}$) from $\ECat$ to $\ECat$. Indeed,
the image of the fibered product of $\in\Sub{X}$ and $\prn{\Idn{X},f}$ ---
therefore of $\in\Sub{X}$ --- over $\Omega\Sup{X}\times Y$ is indeed the
vertical composite depicted below:

\node (XY) [below = of X''] {$X\times Y$};
