The proof is by inspection of the strict pullback $x \tdown_\vf y$ and of the functor $x\btdown y$; $x \tdown_\vf y$ is the subcategory of the product on objects of the form $\left\\{ p,a,q \mid \nbsmat{ Xp &\overset{f}\to& Sa \\\\ Ta &\underset{g}\to& Yq } \right\\}$, and $x\btdown y$ is defined sending such an object to $\left\\{ p,q \mid \nbsmat{UXp &\overset{f}\to& USa \\\\ &\swarrow&\\\\ VTa &\underset{g}\to& VYq } \right\\}$.
