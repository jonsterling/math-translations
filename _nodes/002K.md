  The characterisation of exact grids in $\Ab$ or $\Cat$ is immediate, thanks to the calculus of additive relations in $\Ab$ and the calculus of bimodules in $\Cat$. In a generic symmetric 2-category, we have to resort to an adequate `calculus of relations', as described in the following section. In a category with a Yoneda structure, see the calculus outlined in ยง4.
