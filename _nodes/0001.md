title: Elementary topos

An *elementary topos* is a category $\ECat$ satisfying the following conditions:

1. $\ECat$ inductive and finite projective limits;
2. $\ECat$ admits exponentials: for each $A\in \Ob{\ECat}$, the functor $(-)\times A : \ECat\to\ECat$ admits a right adjoint, written $\prn{-}\Sup{A}$;
3. $\ECat$ has an arrow $v : \ObjTerm{\ECat}\to \Omega$ that for each $X\in \Ob{\ECat}$ the arrows from $X$ to $\Omega$ give by fibered product with $v$ exactly the subobjects of $X$.

We can reduce these axiomatics, as recent work by A. Kock and Ch. Mikkelson
{%cite kock-mikkelsen:1974 -A %} has shown, and describe for example in the manner of F.W. Lawvere {%cite lawvere:1972 -A%} an elementary topos as a cartesian closed category in which the notion of a subobject is representable.
