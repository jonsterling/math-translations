title: The algebra of subobjects
---

We also know that for each object $X$ of a topos $\ECat$, the category $\Sl{\ECat}{X}$ of objects above $X$ is again a topos, and that each arrow $f : X \to Y$ determines a functor $\InvImg{f} : \Sl{\ECat}{Y}\to\Sl{\ECat}{X}$ which admits both a left adjoint (written $\Sigma\Sub{f}$) and a right adjoint (written $\Pi\Sub{f}$).

If we consider just the subobjects of $X$, we obtain a Heyting algebra $\Opns{X}$ and the functor $\InvImg{f}$ induces $f\Sup{-1} : \Opns{Y}\to \Opns{X}$, which likewise admits a right adjoint ($\forall\Sub{f}$, induced by $\Pi\Sub{f}$) and a left adjoint (written $\exists\Sub{f}$, defined by taking the image). By the cartesian adjunction, the objects of $\Opns{X}$ amount to points of $\Omega\Sup{X}$ and the action of the last three functors can be described by arrows of the topos. Thus restricting the image of $A\times f$ to a subobject of $A\times X$ amounts to composing the cartesian adjoint of its characteristic function with the arrow $\exists\Sub{f} : \Omega\Sup{X}\to\Omega\Sup{Y}$, which corresponds exactly to the restriction of the image of $\Omega\Sup{X}\times f$ to $\in\Sub{X}\rightarrowtail \Omega\Sup{X}\times X$ (the subobject characterized by evaluation).
