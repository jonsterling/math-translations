Since the overall problem with $PZ$ is to allow for a deduction theory (cf. ยง5), Lambek-Scott proposed in {%cite CTGDC_1981__22_2_129_0%} to understand $PZ$ as a *deductive set*, i.e. a set $E$ equipped with a relation
$$ \vdash \subseteq (\mathcal{P}_\text{f}E)\times E $$
called *deduction*, satisfying the following axioms:
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\begin{array}{lr}
\{x\} \vdash x & \displaystyle\frac{A\vdash x,\quad A \cup\{x\}\vdash y}{A\vdash y} \\[.5em]
\displaystyle\frac{A\vdash y}{A\cup\{x\}\vdash y} & \displaystyle\frac{\{x\}\vdash y,\quad \{y\}\vdash x}{x = y}
\end{array}
{%endtex%}
If $(L,\le)$ is a complete lattice, we can obtain a deduction structure $\vdash$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
 \{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \vdash y & \iff \bigvee x_i\ge y\\
                            & \iff \bigvee x_i = y\lor \bigvee x_i
\end{align*}
$$
