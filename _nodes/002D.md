- $\vf$ is an absolute extension if and only if $\vf$ is a pointwise extension and can be computed as an absolute colimit if and only if $Y_Z\circ\vf$ is an extension.
- Following ยง1.14 (with 1.1), $\vf$ is an absolute extension if and only if $\vf : \esq FJIR$ is exact, i.e. $\widetilde{\vf}$ is an isomorphism (in such a case, the zig-zag criterion and all local criteria take special forms, see {%cite guitart1977absolues%}).
- $\vf$ is an absolute extension if and only if, taking the comma square $\esq{d_0}{d_1}UF$, the induced functor $J\circ d_1 \downarrow Y \to  Z \downarrow R$ is opaque and surjective on objects.
- As in ยง2.1, $F :  A \to  B$ is opaque if and only if the square

F\downarrow F\ar[r]\ar[d] &  A \ar[d]^F \ar[r]^F&  B\ar@{=}[d] \\
 A \ar[r]_F &\ultwocell<\omit>{\text{comma}}  B \ar@{=}[r] &  B
}
{%endtex%}
is exact, i.e. (cf. ยง1.1) if and only if $F\otimes \widetilde{1_F} : F^\text{o}\otimes F \otimes F^\text{o} \to F^\text{o}$ is an isomorphism, or equivalently if and only if the pro-comonad on $ B$ associated to $F$ (see {%cite harting1977distributoren,thiebaud%}) is idempotent.
- If $ B_F$ is the full subcategory of $ B$ on the image of $F$, i.e. on objects of the form $FA$ for $A\in A_o$, $F$ is opaque if and only if the triangle

 A \ar[rr]\ar[dr]_F &&  B_F \ar[dl]\\

{%endtex%}
is an absolute left extension.
- $F$ is opaque if and only if it can be factored as a composition $T\circ Q$ with $T$ fully faithful and $Q$ co-fully faithful.
- Thanks to Isbell's zig-zag theorem, if $F$ is bijective on objects, then $F$ is opaque if and only if $F$ is an epimorphism of $\Cat$.
