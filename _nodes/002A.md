title: Connection with exactness in $\Ab$
---

- Conditions {%cref 001V%}), {%cref 001Z%}), and {%cref 001Y%}) apply in every representable 2-category, and they are in general not equivalent to each other. A fortiori this is true in every 1-category.
- Considering a 1-category $K$ as a 2-category $\mathbb K$ without nontrivial 2-morphisms, conditions {%cref 001V%}), {%cref 001Z%}) make sense; so, (cf. Hilton {%cite hilton-exacts%}) in $\Ab$ a square
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
A \ar[r]\ar[d]_S& 0 \ar[d]\\
X \ar[r]_U& B
}
{%endtex%}
is exact in the sense {%cref 001V%}) if and only if the sequence $A\to X\to B$ is exact at the object $X$.
- Since $\Ab$ embeds in $\Cat$ [an abelian group is a one-object category, TN], the square above can be regarded in $\Cat$; and it is exact in the 2-category $\Cat$ if and only if $A\to X\to B\to 0$ is exact in $X$ *and* in $B$.
- The calculus of exactness in $\Cat$ is thus an enlargement of the one in $\Ab$; in this spirit, the absolute exact squares (e.g. adjunctions and Yoneda squares) generalise the split exact sequences, and $\tilde\vf$ represents the *homology* of the square $\vf$.
