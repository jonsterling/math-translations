Given the definition of $\tilde\vf$ and since the profunctor composition $\otimes$ is defined by a coend {%cite outline-functorial%}, $\vf$ exact is equivalent to the fact that for all $x\in X_0, y\in Y_0$, the maps $\tilde\vf_{x,y}(a)$ induce an isomorphism

\int^a X[x,Sa] \times Y[Ta, y] \overset\cong\to B[Ux, Vy].
