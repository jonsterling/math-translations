title: Relationship between big and little Ã©tale topoi
---

The relation between $\Sh{\ET/V}$ and $\Sh{M}/\Yo{V}$ is the same as the one between the little topos and the big topos of a topological space {%cite sga:4 -L section -l IV.4.10%}. There is also in SGA4 an exercise whose content is more or less what we have just said. (Puzzle: find a point in common between La Samaritaine and SGA 4.)
