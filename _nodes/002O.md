Let $\mathbb K$ be a 2-category equipped with a *Yoneda structure* in the sense of Street-Walters {%cite Street1978%} (see also {%cite Street1974%}), which means $\mathbb K$ is equipped with a right ideal $\mathbb A\subseteq\mathbb K_1$ of "admissible" 1-arrows, and for every $A\in \mathbb A$ a "Yoneda morphism" $Y_A : A \to PA$ is given so that for each $f : A \to B$ in $\mathbb A$ there is a diagram
{%tex macrolib: guitart%}
\xymatrix{
A \ar@{->}[rr]^{f} \ar@{->}[rd]_{Y_A} &  & B \ar@{->}[ld]^{B(f,1)} \\
    & PA &
}
{%endtex%}
with the property that

- $\chi^f$ exhibits $B(f,1)$ as the left extension of $Y_A$ along $f$;
- $\chi^f$ exhibits $f$ as the absolute lift of $Y_A$ along $B(f,1)$;
- for every $k : B\to PA$ and $\sigma : B(f,1)\To k$, $\sigma$ is an isomorphism in $\mathbb K$ if and only if $(\sigma * f)\circ \chi^f$ exhibits $f$ as absolute lift of $Y_A$ along $k$.
