These are, in fact, the results obtained first in {%cite guitart1977absolues%}, because to reach the notion of exact squares, we started from R. Par√© {%cite pare1969absolute%} absolute limits, we went through the Beck-Chevalley condition {%cite chevalley1964descente%} and the zig-zag theorem of Isbell {%cite Guitart1982%}, and we only belatedly observed the connection of these questions with
the exact squares in abelian categories (in the sense of Lambek {%cite lambek_1958%}, Mac Lane,
Brinkman-Puppe, Hilton {%cite 10.1007/978-3-642-99902-4_11%}), which suggested {%cref 001V%} and {%cref 001Y%} definitions of {%cref 001A%}.
