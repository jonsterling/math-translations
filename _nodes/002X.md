Exact squares in $\Cat$, in representable 2-categories or in 2-categories equipped with a Yoneda structure have been introduced in {%cite guitart:1980%} and, subsequently, the theory has been developed by Van den Bril {cite 10}, {%cite CTGDC_1982__23_2_215_0%} Guitart {%cite Guitart1982%}, Guitart-Lair {cite 7} (in the case of $\Cat$, see here some complementary remarks to ยง12).

One first reason for the success of these 2-dimensional exact squares is that more or less everything one can do in $\Cat$ (e.g., defining comma and co-comma squares, rich functors, opaque functors, co-fully faithful functors, limits and absolute extensions, adjunctions and relative adjunctions, pointwise Kan extensions) is naturally and directly expressible in terms of exact squares.

A second reason is that, in the case of $\Cat$, profunctor composition seen as bi-fibrations is performed again taking into account the key observation of our ยง2.
